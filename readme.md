# Bash Library
This is a library to manage virtual machines without a hassle. We pretty know that there are a lot of tools and open source products that manages virtual machines or servers much more elegantly and/or cleverly. But as an old school people working at PlusClouds R&D department we love things that are basic, simple and old school.
